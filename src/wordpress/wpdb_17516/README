This is the Wordpress database structure, generic data population,
and localized data populuation. These files are specific to a particular Wordpress database schema.
One can update Wordpress versions that have the same DB schema and still use these files.
When the DB Schema is changed, these files need to be revisited.

They are split as
 -structure -- the generic structure of the wordpress DB
 -data-generic -- the generic data in the DB that is not cluster-specific
 -data-local -- the rest of the data in the DB that IS cluster-specific

A sample SQL File would then be generated as
PDATE=`date +'%F %T'`
cat wordpress3-structure.sql wordpress3-data-generic.sql wordpress3-data-local.sql | \
./localize.py "{ '&hostname;':'test','&Kickstart_PublicDNSDomain;':'rocksclusters.org', '&Wordpress_PressDate;':\"$PDATE\", '&Info_ClusterContact;':'user@admin.com' }"
